# Docker

This repository houses a bunch of dockerfiles for custom images
that can be used for DevOps type workloads. I do not guarantee
they work, but as I use them regularly they should be reasonably
up to date.


## Notice
I no longer use "master" in any of my repositories so you will be pulling off "main"
as the default. I highly suggest getting used to main in general.
