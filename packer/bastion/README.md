Bastion:
  * Oracle Linux 8
  * Ubuntu 20.04


This is a bastion I have set up using packer which provides the following applications within
* google-cloud-sdk
* awscli
* helm
* kubectx
* kbuens
* kubeswtich
* k9s
* tfenv
* tgenv
* vault


TODO: Soon I will be doing explicit versioning of these which will include getting rid of tfenv and tgenv and having a specific version of terraform and terragrunt.
